def model_to_clip_transform(points, xy_scale=0.9, z_scale=0.3):
    r"""
    Produces an Affine Transform which centres and scales 3D points to fit
    into the OpenGL clipping space ([-1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, 1-]). This can be
    used to construct an appropriate projection matrix for use in an
    orthographic Rasterizer. Note that the z-axis is flipped as is default in
    OpenGL - as a result this transform converts the right handed coordinate
    input into a left hand one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points: :map:`PointCloud`
        The points that should be adjusted.
    xy_scale: `float` 0-1, optional
        Amount by which the boundary is relaxed so the points are not
        right against the edge. A value of 1 means the extremities of the
        point cloud will be mapped onto [-1, 1] [-1, 1] exactly (no boarder)
        A value of 0.5 means the points will be mapped into the range
        [-0.5, 0.5].

        Default: 0.9 (map to [-0.9, 0.9])

    z_scale: float 0-1, optional
        Scale factor by which the z-dimension is squeezed. A value of 1
        means the z-range of the points will be mapped to exactly fit in
        [1, -1]. A scale of 0.1 means the z-range is compressed to fit in the
        range [0.1, -0.1].

    Build the transformation matrix that can project points into the OpenGL
